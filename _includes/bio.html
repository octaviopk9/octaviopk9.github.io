<h2>Welcome to my page</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I am a researcher specializing in Cryptography,
  currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at <a
    href="https://www.rd.ntt/e/sil/"
    target="_blank">NTT Social Informatics Laboratories</a> under the mentorship
  of Masayuki Abe. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a
    href="https://securite.di.ens.fr/">École Normale Supérieure</a> in 2022. My
  thesis, entitled "Malleable Cryptography: Advances and Applications to
  Privacy-enhancing Technologies", was supervised by <a
    href="https://securite.di.ens.fr/en/david-naccache/"
    target="_blank">David Naccache</a> and <a
    href="https://sancy.iut.uca.fr/~lafourcade/"
    target="_blank">Pascal Lafourcade</a>. I also earned an engineering degree
  (Ing.) in Computer Science from <a
    href="https://www.fing.edu.uy/carrera/grado/ingenier%C3%ADa-en-computaci%C3%B3n"
    target="_blank">Universidad de la República</a>, which I have obtained in
  2018 (ranked 12/599). During my Ph.D. studies, I was a CIFRE fellow working at
  <a href="https://www.be-ys.com"
    target="_blank">be-ys Research</a>, where I focused on blockchain and
  privacy. Prior to that, I was a teaching assistant (Ayudante, Gr. 1) at <a
    href="https://www.fing.edu.uy/es/node/40926"
    target="_blank">Universidad de la República, Uruguay</a> from 2015 to 2018.
  My current research centers on the design and analysis of provably secure and
  practical public-key cryptographic primitives, with a particular focus on
  digital identity. I
  am dedicated to advancing privacy-enhancing technologies that meet the
  challenges of our increasingly digital world. I am a member of the <a
    href="https://www.criptolatino.org/"
    target="_blank">Latin Americans in Cryptography</a> community and the <a
    href="https://www.iacr.org/"
    target="_blank">International Association for Cryptologic Research
    (IACR)</a>.

<p>My full (academic) CV is available upon request. In case you would like to
  know more about me, other information related to my interests outside academia
  can be found <a href="/about.html">on this page</a>. I also share some
  photos from my life in Japan <a href="/photos.html">on this other page</a>. If
  you are a student, you may find useful to check a list of learning resources
  that I provide <a href="/resources.html">here</a>.</p>


<b>SERVICE</b>
<p>I generally set aside time to serve as a reviewer for venues focused on
  Cryptography, and I am always happy to contribute to the community. If you
  believe I can assist, feel free to reach out — just ensure your message is
  specific, as generic or suspicious emails are automatically filtered as spam.
