      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p style="text-align:justify;">I was born and raised in Uruguay. I have always wanted to study abroad, and I have been extremely fortunate to be given such opportunities on more than one occasion. I met incredible people along the way, and I am very thankful for that as well. Before getting into college, I thought I would become a penetration tester or a security engineer. After taking math courses, I got deeply interested in Cryptography and Theoretical Computer Science, which reshaped my interests and drove me to pursue a PhD in Cryptography. I am committed to a vision of global equal opportunities where privacy is an established human right, and I have been trying to push in that direction during my studies.
      </p>

      <h3>Sports</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout my youth, I played basketball at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Bigu%C3%A1_de_Villa_Biarritz"
        target="_blank">Club Biguá</a>. Nowadays, I remain a fan who follows every season and feels extremely happy every time a former teammate signs with Biguá. I think Juan Roman Riquelme was one of the greatest football players of all time, and I guess that is why I follow Boca Juniors as much as I follow Peñarol ;). I love competing and take even for fun ping-pong games very seriously.
      </p>

      <h3>Languages</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">I really like learning languages. I consider myself fluent in Spanish (mother tongue), English and Portuguese, and with a decent French level. Furthermore, I studied Japanese for almost 8 years while I was in school/highschool. During those wonderful years, I was extremely fortunate to study with Hachiuma Sensei. I am currently tryig to improve my French and progress (slowly) with Italian.</p>

      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">I very much enjoy discussing about philosophy, from epistemology to ethics and metaphysics. Although deeply influenced and attracted to existentialist authors, I also enjoy reading about greek mithology and Plato on my spare time.</p>

      
      <h3>Cooking</h3>
      I find cooking a very relaxing and pleasent activity and try to cook as much as I can during the week. Below you can find some recipes/tips that I have tried and highly recommend.
